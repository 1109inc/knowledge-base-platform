## 🔧 Tech Stack Overview

| Layer      | Technology            |
|------------|------------------------|
| Frontend   | React.js               |
| Backend    | Node.js + Express.js   |
| Database   | MongoDB (via Mongoose) |
| Auth       | JWT (JSON Web Tokens)  |
| Editor     | Rich Text (WYSIWYG) - Quill.js or TipTap |

## 🧩 Component Breakdown

### 1. **React Frontend**
- Responsible for:
  - UI rendering
  - Routing (React Router)
  - Auth forms (login/signup/forgot)
  - WYSIWYG document editor
  - Document view & search
- Communicates with backend via Axios or Fetch.

---

### 2. **Express.js Backend**
- RESTful API provider
- Handles:
  - User registration/login/forgot password
  - JWT auth & protected routes
  - Document creation/editing/sharing
  - Mentioning and permission logic
  - Full-text search using MongoDB
  - Sends reset-password emails using Mailtrap SMTP sandbox
---

### 3. **MongoDB Database**
- Stores:
  - User credentials
  - Documents (title, content, metadata)
  - Sharing permissions
  - Mentioned user tracking
- Mongoose schemas will enforce data structure.

---

### 4. **JWT Authentication Middleware**
- Verifies JWT tokens on protected routes
- Ensures that users can only access permitted resources

---

## 🛠️ Optional Enhancements (Bonus Features Implemented)

- ✅ Version control (document history)
- ✅ Compare versions (basic diff view)
- ✅ Email notifications via Mailtrap (reset password)

---

## ⏭️ Still Planned (Future Work)
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics and activity logs

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- JWT for secure stateless auth
- Passwords stored as hashed (bcrypt)
- Private documents only accessible to owner + shared users
- No access to private routes without token
